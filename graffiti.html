<body>In 1980, media began to link graffiti with other emerging urban cultures – those of breakdance and rap music – also produced by youths from the most neglected areas of New York, creating a concept called hip hop. The new cultural object took form in press articles, performance shows and, in particular, in movies, some of which had wide international distribution. Because of this, the public began to believe, as it still does so today, that graffiti in the New York tradition is, from its very inception and by its own nature, a part of hip hop. This conception is so widespread that the term “hip-hop graffiti” is often used to differentiate this type of graffiti from others.</body>

  <body>1. Tagging
  	<br>
  Tagging is the easiest and simplest style of graffiti; it includes one colour and the artist’s name or identifier. It is considered disrespectful to write a tag over another’s artists’s tag or work.</body>

       <br>
   <body>2. Wildstyle 
   	<br>
   Wildstyle is an elaborate version of a throw-up and is particularly hard to read. Wildstyle often consists of arrows, curves, spikes and other things that non graffiti artists might not understand.</body>

    <body>3 Throw-Ups
    	<br>
    A throw-up is like a more complicated tag. It usually has two or more colours, and bubble-style lettering. A throw-up can be done quickly and repeatedly, just like a tag.</body>

     <br>
     <body>4. Blockbuster 
     	<br>
     A blockbuster is like a massive throw-up, usually in blocky letters. Blockbusters are used to cover a large area in a small amount of time. Blockbusters can be painted with rollers, which makes them faster and easier to do.</body>
